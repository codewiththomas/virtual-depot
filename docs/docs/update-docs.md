# Update documentation

Go the same way as starting the app. After environment has been activated, navigate to `/docs` folder.

```bash
cd docs
```

Start a webserver.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The website is now available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

If you want to build the documentation only, run the following command:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This generates a `/site` folder with the static files for the documentation website.
